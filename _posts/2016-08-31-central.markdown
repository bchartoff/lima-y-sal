Last night, Natalie, Janet, Sue and I had dinner at Central, the [fourth best restaurant in the world](http://www.theworlds50best.com/list/1-50-winners/Central). It. Was. Incredible.

We arrived at 7:45 (as far as we can tell, there's only one seating, we were among the first to arrive and the last to leave), and were seated at what must be the best table in the house. The restaurant has an open kitchen, behind an enormous glass wall, and we were maybe 20 feet away from the pass. We could see chef Martinez, dressed in a button up, expediting, tasting, plating, and calmly floating all over the kitchen. Too cool.

*Going over the menu with the kitchen staff*

There are four menu options&mdash;13 or 18 courses, vegetarian or not&mdash;we went with the 18 course meat menu, with wine pairings. The menu organization is really fun&mdash;each dish includes ingredients from a different Peruvian ecosystem, which is defined by an elevation above or below sea level. It's a hyper focus on the concept of "if it grows together it goes together", and celebrates one of the things that makes Peruvian food so thrilling&mdash;travel a few hundred miles and you can cross from ocean, to desert, to mountain, to jungle. While the dishes were not, with a few exceptions, traditional Peruvian dishes, the heart of the restaurant was the heart of Peru.

As best I can, I'm going to describe each dish and drink from last night. The photos are blurry, and I might have forgotten an ingredient here or there, but this is a meal I never want to forget. Future Ben, if you're reading this, remember that veal?! That lettuce?! Those gnocchi?! And present family and friends, if you're reading this get ready to hear about veal! and lettuce! and gnocchi (and a lot of parenthetical descriptions of unfamiliar ingredients)!

<div class = "drink_title">Pisco Tumbo Coca cocktail</div>
We had a cocktail paired with the first three courses. Tumbo ("banana passion fruit") is one of my favorite Peruvian fruits&mdash;similar to passion fruit, but much less tart, sweet and fruity. Mixed with Pisco (I think an italia grape), coca leaf, and dried citrus peel. Delicious start to the meal.

A dehydrated crab cracker (definitely similar to the shrimp crackers from Asian supermarkets), then a layer of limpet (an aquatic snail&mdash;a little chewy texture and more seafood flavor), then a citrus cream, and topped with sargassum, the same seaweed that ubiquitously tops ceviche all over Lima. What a first bite.

*In general, some really cool serving dishes*

Natalie's maybe allergic to crab (and lobster and scallops), so she got a shot of pacae (bean tree!) leche de tigre, with a little sandwich of sargassum ice cream between sea weed crackers made from a different seaweed. She loved it.

<div class="dish_title">Desert Plants</div>
<div class="ingredients">Huarango &#9675; Lucuma &#9675; Root <span>160 M</span></div>

The next two little bites were both built around a lucuma mousse (a creamy fruit, common in ice cream). It's not normally a flavor with a lot of character, but was really highlighted by some great components, but not overpowered. First, there was an amazing cracker made from onion ash (super savory and a little bitter), then the mousse and some gorgeous little crisp and spicy flowers (most of the gorgeous little snipped herb and flower garnishes come from the garden on the restaurant's roof).

*The colors duke, the colors!*

Next, a "bread" made from huarango wood (carob tree, most often used in Peru to make algarrobina, a syrup somewhere between honey and molasses) which had a texture somewhere between cotton candy and mochi, and a nice earthy flavor. More mousse, coated in lucuma seeds (more a texture than a flavor, something like dried coconut). Like many of the single bite dishes, absolutely delightful textural contrasts.

<div class="dish_title">High Sierra Lake</div>
<div class="ingredients">Mashua &#9675; Duck &#9675; Zapallo Squash <span>3500 M</span></div>

The beautiful little root in huarango (the root of the carob tree&mdash;unlike many of the odd tubers, this is one I see every day in the market), which was thinly sliced and deep fried. Inside, there were two creamy sauces, one brigth green (looking and tasting) of zapallo (I think it was zapallo italiano, which are a kind of zucchini), and another of Andean duck. Rich and green to start, with a tart and ducky finish. The beautifully diced salsa on top was red onion, chili, lime, and something green (more zukes?)

<div class = "drink_title">Fundo El Quintanar, Albita 2015</div>
The first glass of wine was an Albilla, an orange wine. I don't know enough about wine, in general, to really describe these wines. But it was superb. Sort of, savory? Whatever it was delicious.
</div>

Three componenets to this course, all built around corn. First, a little cracker or dehydrated red corn, with pastes of yellow and purple corn (somewhere between a fudge and cornbread texture), and fried corn silk. Great textures, good flavors.

Next was a little cracker of corn, with cracked dried corn and honey (super reminiscent of a cornflake) with an absolutely astoundingly delicious drink they called "corn milk" with tumbo. Pureed yellow corn with tumbo juice, thick and creamy, sweet and sour, absolutely intoxicating.

<div class="dish_title">High Jungle</div>
<div class="ingredients">Yacon &#9675; Baston &#9675; Bark <span>860 M</span></div>

Yacon is the root of a daisy, which our waiter told us tastes a bit like yuca, but sweeter. It was smoked over the wood which it's served on (those gorgeous little curly things). And, travesty of travesties, I forget what the yellow sauce was. But it was crisp like a water chestnut, with a little smokey finish, and juicy as a cucumber. Straight up fun.

*Oh mystery sauce. What were you*

<div class="dish_title">River Scales</div>
<div class="ingredients">River Snails &#9675; Gamitana &#9675; Sangre de Arbol <span>180 M</span></div>

A gorgeous dish, without a whole ton of flavor. But gorgeous, and nice textures. It was a black chia seed cracker, with a cream of snails (shellfishy) and sangre de arbol (a red tree sap, I'm sure there was a flavor but I think mainly there for the color), with shredded flower petals.

*Loverly*

Natalie got a similar cracker, with a puree and some fried bits both made from a palm tree (palm trees, a variety of different species of them, were all over the menu).

Oh wow. This course.
